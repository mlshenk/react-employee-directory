## Description
This is an employee directory that is build with react and axios, and pulls stock employees from an API using a mongo database. The user can generate cards with an employee's name and contact information for a desired number of employees. The user can then sort them by gender or alphabetically by last name. Mongo supplied the database for these cards and react expedited the API response and render time.

## Screenshot
The below screenshot shows the stock employee cards sorted by their last name.
